    <p class="p">Hello! My name is Sophia Alexandra Kalamas. I am a junior at Piedmont High School and have so many fun things to tell you about myself. I play tennis through the school, I dance in my free time, and I love to play the piano for my family and friends. Something not very many people know is that my favorite animal is a polar bear! I love butterflies, the color pink, and anything with glitter. </p>
